# E-commerce Profitability

Final Year Project Title: **Exploring Profitability Drivers in E-commerce Using Data Mining**

This project is conducted to identify the key drivers of profitability in the e-commerce industry through the application of data mining techniques. An e-commerce dataset with 180,519 rows and 53 columns was collected from an open-source website and underwent Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data preprocessing. A hybrid model consisting of RFM Model, K-Means Clustering, STL Decomposition and Linear Regression algorithms were constructed to achieve different outputs such as customer segmentation, trend analysis and profit forecasting. The Linear Regression model outperformed the other forecasting models with MAE of 25.06 and RMSE of 31.42. The other model performances were showcased and evaluated in Power BI dashboards with detailed analysis.
